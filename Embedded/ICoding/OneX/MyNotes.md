Quick notes:
FSM = Finite State Machines
Modern Embedded Systems - state machines
Efficient implementation of state machines

Do you have any recommendation for what kind of Scheduling Policy do I need implement? 
	-	Preemptive/Non preemptive
	-	FIFO
	-	Round robin 
	-	Shortest job first
	-	Priority Scheduling
	-	Multilevel queue
	-	Multilevel Feedback queue
	-	Fair Scheduler
