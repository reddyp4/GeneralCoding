/*
Given an array representing the weights/fitness, write a function that returns the index that corresponds to the highest weight given. Note that this is a stochastic function and as such does not return the same value at each call. 
For example:
A = [1, 2, 4, 8]

Function will return
3 : 8/15 of the times, 15 being the sum of the given array = 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 = 15
2: 4/15 of the times
1: 2/15 of the times
0: 1/15 of the times
