#You have access to a database of student_scores in the format of a dictionary. 
# The keys in student_scores are the names of the students and the values are their 
# exam scores.
#Write a program that converts their scores to grades. By the end of your program, 
# you should have a new dictionary called student_grades that should contain student 
# names for keys and their grades for values. The final version of the student_grades 
# dictionary will be checked.
#DO NOT modify lines 1-7 to change the existing student_scores dictionary.
#DO NOT write any print statements.
#This is the scoring criteria:
#Scores 91 - 100: Grade = "Outstanding"
#Scores 81 - 90: Grade = "Exceeds Expectations"
#Scores 71 - 80: Grade = "Acceptable"
#Scores 70 or lower: Grade = "Fail"
#Expected Output
#'{'Harry': 'Exceeds Expectations', 'Ron': 'Acceptable', 'Hermione': 'Outstanding', 'Draco': 'Acceptable', 'Neville': 'Fail'}'
#Hint
#Remember that looping through a Dictionary will only give you the keys and not the values.
#If in doubt as to why your code is not doing what you expected, you can always print out the intermediate values.
#At the end of your program, the print statement will show the final student_scores dictionary, do not change this.
