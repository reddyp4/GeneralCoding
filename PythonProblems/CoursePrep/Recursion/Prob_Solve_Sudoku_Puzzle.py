Solve Sudoku Puzzle

Given a partially filled two-dimensional array, fill all the unfilled cells such that each row, each column and each 3 x 3 subgrid (as highlighted below by bolder lines) has every digit from 1 to 9 exactly once.

Unfilled cells have a value of 0 on the given board.

Example
Example one

{
"board": [
[8, 4, 9, 0, 0, 3, 5, 7, 0],
[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[7, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 8, 3],
[0, 0, 0, 9, 4, 6, 7, 0, 0],
[0, 8, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 4, 0],
[0, 0, 6, 8, 7, 2, 0, 0, 0],
[5, 7, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 4],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0],
[0, 2, 1, 7, 0, 0, 8, 6, 5]
]
}
Output:

[
[8, 4, 9, 1, 6, 3, 5, 7, 2],
[3, 1, 5, 2, 8, 7, 4, 9, 6],
[7, 6, 2, 4, 9, 5, 1, 8, 3],
[1, 5, 3, 9, 4, 6, 7, 2, 8],
[2, 8, 7, 3, 5, 1, 6, 4, 9],
[4, 9, 6, 8, 7, 2, 3, 5, 1],
[5, 7, 8, 6, 1, 9, 2, 3, 4],
[6, 3, 4, 5, 2, 8, 9, 1, 7],
[9, 2, 1, 7, 3, 4, 8, 6, 5]
]
