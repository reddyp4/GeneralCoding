'''
path sum

similar to left/right pointers

def subProblem()

def findSum(root:treenode, target:int):
    currentsum=0
    subProblem(root,target,currentsum)

By default: recursive is a stack operation

Time Compelxity: O(n) - May need to traverse the full length

Space Complexity: O(n) - Not a binary tree - just linked list
