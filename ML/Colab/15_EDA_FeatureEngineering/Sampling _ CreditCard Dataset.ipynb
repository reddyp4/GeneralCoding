So we shall standardise the Amount data, since all the other columns have been obtained through PCA, and PCA ALWAYS works on Standardised data."],"metadata":{"id":"sW70cVe98T0u"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\n","sc = StandardScaler()\n","creditcard_dataset['standard_Amount']=sc.fit_transform(creditcard_dataset['Amount'].values.reshape(-1,1))"],"metadata":{"id":"-1IUQ2bp6zLI","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1685857495015,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":339,"user":{"displayName":"Adityan","userId":"18027481726286131640"}}},"execution_count":10,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["creditcard_dataset.head(n=4)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":268},"id":"0akDS4yx9JmG","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1685857495015,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":12,"user":{"displayName":"Adityan","userId":"18027481726286131640"}},"outputId":"e5559e73-a1dc-4653-8ecd-824cf26407e0"},"execution_count":11,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["   Time        V1        V2        V3        V4        V5        V6        V7  \\\n","0   0.0 -1.359807 -0.072781  2.536347  1.378155 -0.338321  0.462388  0.239599   \n","1   0.0  1.191857  0.266151  0.166480  0.448154  0.060018 -0.082361 -0.078803   \n","2   1.0 -1.358354 -1.340163  1.773209  0.379780 -0.503198  1.800499  0.791461   \n","3   1.0 -0.966272 -0.185226  1.792993 -0.863291 -0.010309  1.247203  0.237609   \n","\n","         V8        V9  ...
